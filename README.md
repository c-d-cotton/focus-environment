# Introduction
This project allows the user to run a script to help them to focus on work until a specified time. It does this by:
- Starting whitenoise which lasts until the specified time.
- Outputting a document which gives the date but not the time and explains why (this can be loaded by something like linux-popupinfo).

# Setup
Run setup_submodules.sh to add in required submodules.
